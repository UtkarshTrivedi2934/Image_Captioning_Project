# Image_Captioning_Project

Working:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
CNNs are widely used for image processing tasks. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input images.
A pre-trained CNN model like VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 is often used as a feature extractor. The CNN processes the input image and extracts meaningful features at different levels of abstraction.
These extracted features capture various visual aspects of the image such as shapes, textures, and objects.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):
LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to handle sequences of data while addressing the vanishing gradient problem.
LSTMs are used to generate captions by processing the sequence of extracted image features.
The LSTM model learns to generate captions word by word, taking into account both the features extracted from the image and the previously generated words.

Model Architecture:
The CNN-LSTM architecture typically consists of two main components: the CNN encoder and the LSTM decoder.
CNN Encoder: This component takes an input image and processes it through the pre-trained CNN to extract relevant features. These features serve as the input to the LSTM decoder.
LSTM Decoder: This component takes the extracted features from the CNN encoder and generates captions word by word. At each time step, the LSTM receives the current word embedding (generated or sampled) along with the previously generated words' context (in the form of hidden states) and predicts the next word in the sequence.
The model is trained end-to-end using a large dataset of paired images and their corresponding captions. During training, the model learns to minimize the difference between the predicted captions and the ground truth captions.

Training Process:
The training process involves feeding pairs of images and their corresponding captions to the model.
The CNN encoder extracts features from the input images, which are then passed to the LSTM decoder.
The LSTM decoder generates captions word by word, and the model's predictions are compared to the ground truth captions using a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss).
Backpropagation is used to update the parameters of both the CNN encoder and the LSTM decoder in order to minimize the loss and improve the model's captioning performance.
